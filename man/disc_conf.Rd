\method{print}{disc_conf}(x, ...)
}

\description{
Read and write project-level settings
}
\details{
Settings are read, in order, from the defaults, then the
configuration file in the deployments directory and finally
from the arguments provided in \code{...}. Then those
settings are set with the function
\code{\link[base]{options}} to be accessible from any other
function in \code{discuss}. Finally, the non-default
settings are stored in the file \code{"disc.conf"} in the
deployments directory.
